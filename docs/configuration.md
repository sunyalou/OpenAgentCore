title: "Configuration reference"
---

Every setting of a Core installation has exactly one home. There are two kinds:

| Kind | Examples | Home | Change it with | Takes effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Process settings](#process-settings-configjson) | Public URL, ports, logging, harnesses, execution concurrency, audit retention, OAuth origins, database pool, Runtime history export | `config.json` in the installation directory (default `~/.oac/core`) | Web domain setup or `oac domain` for managed HTTPS; otherwise edit the file, then run `oac apply` | `oac apply` restarts the services that read the changed settings |
| [Runtime settings](#runtime-settings-web) | Sandbox backend and size, nodes, Projects and keys, default models, executor credentials | Core's PostgreSQL database | Web, or the Core API (`/core/v1`) with the Core key | Saved without a Core restart; nodes prepare Runtime changes asynchronously |

Web's **System** page shows the installation's addresses, the default models, the sandbox configuration and, under **Startup settings**, the process settings read-only with the path of `config.json` and the apply command. Secrets live in [`secrets/`](#installation-directory), one copy each. The files in `generated/` are derived from `config.json`. No configuration file defines Projects or API keys.

## Process settings: config.json

The installer writes every setting, so the file shows each value. Installer flags listed in [installation options](./getting-started/install-options.md) only seed it. To change a setting, edit the file and apply it:

```sh
~/.oac/core/oac apply --dry-run   # show the changed settings, files and restarts
~/.oac/core/oac apply
```

### How oac apply works

1. It validates `config.json` and changes nothing if a value is invalid. `ingress` is fixed after installation; to change it, install into a new directory. It also checks the listeners that a changed `host`, port or managed-ingress `public_url` adds ([ports](./getting-started/install-options.md#ports)), and changes nothing if `host` is not an address of this machine or another program holds one of their ports; the installation's own listeners do not count.
2. It writes the files Core, Web and Compose read into `generated/`: `compose.json`, `core.env`, `core-key-digests.json`, `settings.json` and, when used, `runtime-history.json` and the managed `Caddyfile`. Don't edit them. A generated file edited by hand stops `apply` until you move the change into `config.json` and run `oac apply --discard-edits`, which keeps the edited copy as `generated/<file>.edited-<time>`.
3. It compares what it wrote with what actually runs. Each container carries a digest of its inputs (the `io.oac.inputs` label), and `apply` recreates or restarts exactly the services whose inputs differ: Core first, then Web. The **Restarts** column below says which services a setting affects; see [stop and restart](./getting-started/operations.md#stop-and-restart) for what a restart interrupts.
4. While any service runs, `apply` also starts the stopped ones. After `oac stop`, it only writes the files and the installation stays stopped.
5. If Core refuses a value at startup, `apply` prints Core's startup error. If every service was running with the previous files, it restores them and starts the services again; otherwise it reports the failure, and the next `apply` finishes the work.

`oac status` reports changes to `config.json` that are not applied yet and generated files edited by hand.

### Changing the public URL

`public_url` is the one origin that applications, nodes, sandboxes and self-hosted executors use. Core derives the daemon WebSocket URL, the self-hosted `remote_url` and each sandbox's connection address from it. With `null`, Core uses its loopback origin. Until `public_url` is set, a managed installation serves only Web, over HTTP on the host's IP address at `ports.web`; afterwards that address redirects to `public_url`.

With managed ingress, change it in Web (**System** → **Configure domain and HTTPS**) or with `oac domain HOSTNAME`. Both take the installation lock, verify the new certificate and address, then write `config.json` and apply it. With external ingress, update your reverse proxy first, then edit `public_url` and run `oac apply`.

When nodes, hosted sandboxes or self-hosted executors are bound to the current address, `apply` lists them and asks you to type the new URL (`--confirm-public-url-change URL` without a terminal). Afterwards:

- Nodes on the old address get no new sandboxes: remove them in Web and add them again.
- Existing sandboxes and executors keep working only while the old address still reaches this Core. A managed domain change replaces the previous domain route.
- Self-hosted executors must restart with the new `remote_url`, and their installer refuses an installation made for the old address: create new self-hosted Sessions and connect their hosts again.

### Settings

`core.runtime_history.headers` may hold export credentials. They stay in the `0600` `config.json` and the generated file Core reads, and never appear in `oac` output or in Core's settings snapshot. Model providers are not process settings; see [Default models](#default-models).

[//]: # (END config-reference)

The schema is [`deploy/install/config.schema.json`](https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/OpenAgentCore/blob/main/deploy/install/config.schema.json); each installation keeps a copy in `generated/config.schema.json` for editors. Core serves the non-secret settings snapshot, with the path of `config.json` and the apply command, at `GET /core/v1/installation`. How Core collects and keeps Runtime history is in [retained history](../contracts/agents-api/runtime-observability.md#retained-history-and-optional-export).

## Runtime settings: Web

Runtime settings live in Core's database. Change them in Web; scripts use the same Core API with the Core key.

| Setting | Where in Web | Core API | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sandbox backend: Docker, microsandbox or E2B | **System** → **Manage sandbox configuration**: the setup wizard, ending with **Save configuration** | `/core/v1/sandbox/deployment` | One backend per installation. The installer saves microsandbox at the Standard size. Another backend needs **Reset deployment** first; see [change the sandbox configuration](./getting-started/nodes.md#change-the-sandbox-configuration) |
| Sandbox size, Runtime release, E2B key and template build | **System** → **Manage sandbox configuration** → **Change resources** | `/core/v1/sandbox/deployment` | Web proposes the sizes in [`standard-sizes.json`](https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/OpenAgentCore/blob/main/apps/web/src/features/sandbox/standard-sizes.json). Existing sandboxes keep their size and release. The E2B key is write-only and encrypted |
| Nodes and their capacity | **Nodes**: **Add node**; **Edit node** and **Remove node** on a node's page | `/core/v1/sandbox/enrollment-tokens`, `/core/v1/sandbox/nodes` | See [Node capacity](#node-capacity) and the [nodes guide](./getting-started/nodes.md) |
| Projects and API keys | **Projects and keys**: **Create project**, **Rename**, **Issue key**, **Revoke**, **Archive** | `/core/v1/projects` | Keys are shown once; Core stores digests |
| Default model per harness | **System** → **Default model configuration**: **Set** | `/core/v1/harnesses/{harness}/model-configuration` | See [Default models](#default-models) |
| Executor credentials of a self-hosted Session | **Session log**, then the **Session** page: **Executor credentials** | `/core/v1/projects/{project_id}/environments/{environment_id}/executor-credentials` | See [self-hosted executors](./getting-started/self-hosted.md) |

Which harnesses are enabled, and the default one, are process settings (`core.harnesses`, `core.default_harness`); System shows them read-only. The [Core administration API](../contracts/agents-api/admin-api.md) lists every Core API route, and the [deployment contract](../contracts/agents-api/sandbox-deployment.md) defines the sandbox fields, limits and change rules.

### Node capacity

Core approves a node's capacity when you generate its Add node command: **Sandboxes at once** (`max_active`, default 2) and, for microsandbox only, **Retained sandboxes** (`max_retained`, default 8), with `max_retained >= max_active >= 1`. Docker never suspends sandboxes, so Web doesn't ask for it and Core keeps `max_retained` equal to `max_active`. Change them later with **Edit node**. Reservations and cleanup that is not confirmed count against capacity; lowering a limit stops no running sandbox. A node's own files can't change its capacity, size or Runtime.

`core.execution_concurrency` is unrelated: it limits concurrent execution work in Core.

### Default models

Set a default in **System** → **Default model configuration**, or use `PUT /core/v1/harnesses/{harness}/model-configuration`. Core encrypts provider keys with `secrets/credential.key` and never returns them. [Model execution](../contracts/agents-api/model-execution.md#deployment-defaults) owns the request fields and replacement rules, and [precedence](../contracts/agents-api/model-execution.md#saved-defaults-and-precedence) says which Sessions use a default.

## Compose installations

The [standalone Compose template](./getting-started/install-options.md#docker-compose-and-hosting-platforms) uses its Compose definition and the platform's environment as the source of process settings. An unset or empty `OAC_PUBLIC_URL` selects `http://localhost:8080`, allowing startup before a public domain is configured. Core and Web receive that same value. For public access, set `OAC_PUBLIC_URL` to the exact public HTTPS origin without a trailing slash and redeploy Core and Web with the same project and volumes; changing an environment variable requires container recreation, not just a restart. Configure the public origin before adding nodes or executors. The platform owns TLS and routes to `gateway:8080`; Web's installer-managed domain setup is unavailable.

The initialization service generates secrets and the installation ID once, then verifies them on subsequent deployments. Each secret has one persistent source; Core's key digest is derived from Web's sign-in key. Initialization never replaces missing or changed secrets on an existing installation. Core reads its existing process environment and file settings, so the installer-specific `config.json`, `oac apply` and startup settings snapshot do not apply to this deployment.

| Compose volume | Content | Readers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `database` | PostgreSQL data | PostgreSQL; initialization checks whether it is empty |
| `database-secret` | Generated database password | PostgreSQL, migrator and Core |
| `core-config` | Credential encryption key, installation ID, Core key digest and initialization receipt | Migrator and Core |
| `web-secret` | Generated Core sign-in key | Web and the explicit `credentials` tool |
| `core-state` | Private Provider state | Core |
| `node-payload` | Verified node installation metadata | Web |

Initialization prepares these volumes; application services receive their secret volumes read-only. The `credentials` tool disables container logging. Retrieve its output only in an operator terminal. Database passwords and credential encryption keys are never printed.

The Compose project name scopes the volumes. Preserve every volume together with that project's definition and public URL. Removing only secret volumes does not reset an installation; initialization refuses to start over an existing database. Core also binds the installation ID to its database. Runtime settings continue to live in [Core's database](#runtime-settings-web).

## Docker node configuration

The node installer writes Docker’s provider configuration into the node’s configuration file; these fields are separate from Core’s `config.json`. Deployment resources, Runtime images and capacity remain in [Core’s database](#runtime-settings-web).

| Field | Installer value | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | `unix:///var/run/docker.sock` | Explicit Docker Engine socket |
| `network` | `oac-node-<installation-id>` | Runtime container network |
| `seccomp_file` | `<node-root>/runtime/seccomp.json` | Matched distribution’s seccomp profile |
| `nested_sandbox` | `true` | Enables the Docker adapter’s init process and proc-mask configuration |
| `extra_hosts` | Optional | Additional container host mappings |

The [Docker adapter](./sandbox-provider.md#docker-adapter) owns container isolation, volume layout and lifecycle behavior.

## Installation directory

The installer creates the installation directory, `~/.oac/core` by default, with mode `0700`; the files in `secrets/` are `0600`.

| Path | Content | Changed by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `config.json` | [Process settings](#process-settings-configjson). The only file you edit | You, then `oac apply`; managed domain setup for `public_url` |
| `oac` | The [management command](./getting-started/operations.md#the-oac-command) | The installer |
| `state.json` | Installation ID, Compose project name, image IDs, source commit, the digests of generated files and whether the services have started once | The tools only |
| `secrets/core.key` | The [Core key](./getting-started/operations.md#core-key) | `oac rotate-core-key` |
| `secrets/credential.key` | Encryption key for what Core stores sealed in the database: model providers, the E2B key, Vault credentials, Skills, initial files and environment setup | Nothing. Keep it with the database; `oac apply` refuses a changed file |
| `secrets/database.password` | PostgreSQL password | Nothing. PostgreSQL reads it only when the database is created; `oac apply` refuses a changed file |
| `generated/` | Files derived from `config.json` | `oac apply` |
| `node-payload/` | The node installer and node files that Web serves at `/node-install/`, one directory per release | The installer |
| `native-installers/` | Self-hosted daemon installers for each platform, with their catalog, when the bundle carries them | The installer |
| `state/e2b/` | Private E2B receipts | Core |
| `ingress/` | Managed HTTPS: certificates and gateway state, domain setup status and the control sockets | The `gateway` and `installation` services |
| `.oac.lock` | The installation lock | The installer and mutating `oac` commands |

Only managed ingress has `ingress/`.

In Docker, the Compose project is named `oac-<10 hex digits>` (`project` in `state.json`). Its services are `database`, `migrate`, `core` and `web`, plus `gateway` and `installation` with managed ingress. `gateway` routes to Core and Web and publishes `ports.web`, plus [80 and 443](./getting-started/install-options.md#ports) once HTTPS is on; `installation` applies domain changes from Web and uses the Docker socket to do so. The volume `<project>_database` holds all data. Apart from Docker's storage, nothing is written outside your home directory.

## Appendix: Core environment without the installer

Core reads only its environment. The installer renders `generated/core.env` from `config.json`; if you run Core yourself (see the [service guide](https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/OpenAgentCore/blob/main/services/core/README.md)), set these variables. Compose loads the file with `env_file`, so Compose must be 2.26.0 or newer.

| Variable | Set from |
| --- | --- |
| `OAC_PUBLIC_URL` | `public_url`, or Core's loopback origin. Core derives the daemon WebSocket URL, the self-hosted `remote_url`, the hosted sandbox address and the deployment's read-only `core_url` from it, never from request headers. Without it, Core runs no Runtime gateway and executes no Sessions |
| `OAC_ADDR` | The installer sets `:8091` in the container. Independently started Core defaults to `127.0.0.1:8091` when unset or empty |
| `OAC_DATABASE_URL` | The installation's PostgreSQL without a password, plus `core.database_pool` as `pool_*` query parameters |
| `OAC_DATABASE_PASSWORD_FILE` | `secrets/database.password`. The URL must then carry no password; migrations and the maintenance commands read the file too |
| `OAC_CREDENTIAL_KEY_FILE` | `secrets/credential.key` |
| `OAC_CORE_KEY_DIGESTS_FILE` | `generated/core-key-digests.json`: a JSON array with the SHA-256 of the Core key |
| `OAC_INSTALLATION_ID` | The installation ID from `state.json`, a canonical UUID. It enables the sandbox deployment and node routes and requires `OAC_PUBLIC_URL` and `OAC_CORE_KEY_DIGESTS_FILE`. Core refuses an ID other than the one its database recorded, so keep the two together |
| `OAC_SETTINGS_FILE` | `generated/settings.json`, the snapshot Core serves at `GET /core/v1/installation`; Core does not act on it |
| `OAC_EXECUTION_CONCURRENCY`, `OAC_DEFAULT_HARNESS`, `OAC_WRITE_AUDIT_RETENTION`, `OAC_OAUTH_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` | The matching [process settings](#settings); omitted or empty default Harness uses `core.default_harness`’s documented default |
| `OAC_HARNESSES` | `core.harnesses` with the installer. Independently started Core enables only the default Harness when unset; comma-separated explicit names supplement it. Entries are trimmed and deduplicated; unknown names stop startup |
| `OAC_HISTORY_SETTINGS_FILE` | `generated/runtime-history.json`: the [`core.runtime_history`](#settings) object, when it is set |
| `OAC_LOG_LEVEL`, `OAC_LOG_FORMAT`, `OAC_LOG_ADD_SOURCE` | `log.*`; Web reads the same three |
| `OAC_PROVIDER_ROOT` | Absolute adapter artifact root: `/opt/oac` in the Core image. Each adapter owns its helper paths beneath this root |
| `OAC_PROVIDER_STATE_ROOT` | Absolute private state root: `/state` in the Core image. Each adapter owns its subdirectory; E2B uses `e2b/`, owned by Core's user with no group or other access. Back it up with the database and `credential.key`; don't mount it into Web or a Runtime |
| `OAC_NATIVE_INSTALLER_DIR` | `native-installers/`, served to self-hosted machines; the Core image has a copy at `/opt/oac/native-installers`, used when this is unset. Core checks the catalog against its own release before serving it |

Core logs the file paths it loads, never environment values or file contents.

Invalid explicit OAuth trusted origins stop Core at startup. Entries must be HTTPS origins without credentials, query or a non-root path; the installer validates `core.oauth_trusted_origins` before generating them. [Vaults](../contracts/agents-api/vaults.md) owns refresh and network policy. A private issuer also needs a trusted CA: independently managed Unix Core can use Go’s `SSL_CERT_FILE` PEM CA-bundle override, which preserves certificate verification. Managed installation has no custom-CA setting or mount; do not edit `generated/core.env`.

## Appendix: Web environment without the installer

The installer sets these variables from `config.json`; set them yourself only when you run the console without the installer. Of the installation's secrets, the installer gives the console only `secrets/core.key`.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OAC_WEB_ADDR` | `:8080` | Listener address |
| `OAC_WEB_ORIGIN` | `http://127.0.0.1:8080` | The exact browser-facing origin, HTTP or HTTPS, without a path. Host and origin checks use it; HTTPS makes the session cookie `Secure` |
| `OAC_WEB_UPSTREAM` | `http://core:8091` | Core's origin, HTTP or HTTPS, without credentials, query or path |
| `OAC_WEB_CORE_KEY_FILE` | `/admin/core.key` | Absolute path of a regular file with no group or other permissions, holding the Core key: at least 32 characters, no whitespace, at most 4 KiB |
| `OAC_WEB_DIST` | `/www` | Absolute directory of the built console; must contain `index.html` |
| `OAC_WEB_NODE_PAYLOAD_DIR` | unset | Absolute path of the matched distribution's node payload (the installer's `node-payload/`). Unset, `/node-install/*` is not served and Add node is unavailable |
| `OAC_WEB_INSTALLATION_SOCKET` | unset | Absolute path of the installer's domain socket. Unset, domain setup reports unsupported |
| `OAC_WEB_BOOTSTRAP` | `0` | `1` accepts literal-IP hosts before a domain is configured. Requires an `http://` origin and `OAC_WEB_INSTALLATION_SOCKET` |

Defaults apply when a variable is absent; an explicitly empty value is validated as supplied. An invalid `OAC_WEB_*` value stops the console at startup with a message naming the variable. The console also reads `OAC_LOG_LEVEL`, `OAC_LOG_FORMAT` and `OAC_LOG_ADD_SOURCE` ([Core environment](#appendix-core-environment-without-the-installer)); unknown values fall back to their defaults. Use HTTPS for any browser that is not on the same machine.
