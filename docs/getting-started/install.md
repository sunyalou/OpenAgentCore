title: "Install Core and Web"
---

One command installs Core, the Web console and PostgreSQL on a Linux host. Sign in to Web with the Core key, set a default model and issue Project API keys. Applications call Core with those keys. Sessions run in sandboxes on nodes you add, or on E2B.

1. [Check the prerequisites](#prerequisites).
2. [Run the installer](#install).
3. [Sign in to Web](#sign-in-to-web).
4. [Configure the public address](#configure-the-domain-and-https).
5. [Set a default model](#set-a-default-model).
6. [Issue a Project API key](#issue-a-project-api-key).
7. [Add sandbox capacity](#add-sandbox-capacity).

This page follows the default path. Every flag, existing reverse proxies and offline hosts are in [installation options](./install-options.md).

## Prerequisites

- Linux amd64 and curl.
- Docker Engine with Docker Compose 2.26.0 or newer (`docker compose version`).
- An account that can run `docker` and write to its home directory. Ordinary users and root both work; the installer never calls sudo.
- Free port 8080 for Web. Core's admin API uses `127.0.0.1:8091`. See [ports](./install-options.md#ports). Docker must be able to publish them; the installer does not change host policy.
- For anything off this machine, the origin in `OAC_PUBLIC_URL` must be the address browsers, nodes and executors use. You can sign in on this machine first.

The Core host needs no KVM; nodes that run microsandbox do.

## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/OpenAgentCore/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```

If a reverse proxy already serves this host, pass its HTTPS address:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/OpenAgentCore/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash -s -- --public-url https://core.example
```

The script downloads that release's Compose files, checks their SHA-256, and:

1. checks Linux amd64, Docker Compose 2.26 or newer, and that the ports it will publish are free;
2. creates the [installation directory](../configuration.md#installation-directory), `~/.oac/core`, writes `.env`, and copies the `oac` command out of the Core image;
3. starts the services with Docker Compose. Web serves the console on port 8080 and forwards `/v1`, `/api/v1` and `/docs` to Core. Core's admin API stays on `127.0.0.1:8091`. PostgreSQL is not published.

It saves no sandbox backend, adds no node, creates no Project or key and makes no model request. It ends by printing the console address and how to read the Core key.

If installation fails before the services become healthy, the installer removes the directory it created. Fix the reported cause and rerun the same command. Once the services have started, a later failure keeps the installation and its data. A new release is a new directory; see [version policy](./operations.md#installation-version-policy).

For insufficient space or quota, free space on the filesystem named by the error. Image-loading failures can also require space in Docker's storage, which may be on a different filesystem.

## Sign in to Web

1. On this machine, open `http://localhost:8080`, or the origin you passed with `--public-url`. Web accepts only that host.
2. Sign in with the [Core key](./operations.md#core-key), the installation's administrator credential. Web has no user accounts.

   ```sh
   ~/.oac/core/oac core-key --show
   ```

## Configure the public address {#configure-the-domain-and-https}

Applications, nodes and sandboxes reach Core at one HTTPS address, the public URL.

1. Point your reverse proxy at Web.
2. Set `OAC_PUBLIC_URL` to the HTTPS origin it serves, then run `oac apply`. See [changing the public URL](../configuration.md#changing-the-public-url).

When the proxy serves a certificate from a private certificate authority, node hosts must trust that CA: see [HTTPS and the reverse proxy](./install-options.md#https-and-the-reverse-proxy) and [Add and manage nodes](./nodes.md#before-you-add-a-node).

## Set a default model

Core-hosted Sessions without their own model provider use their harness's default model. On **System**, under **Default model configuration**, find the harness marked **Default** (Codex unless you changed `core.default_harness`) and choose **Set**. Enter the model ID, the protocol, and the provider's base URL and API key. MiniMax Code also needs the context window and max output tokens. See [default models](../configuration.md#default-models).

## Issue a Project API key

1. On **Projects and keys**, choose **Create project**, then **Issue key**. The dialog shows the key once: copy it and keep it safe. Its **How to call** card shows the API base URL and sample requests.
2. Give the key and the API base URL to the application developer. They continue with the [quickstart](./quickstart.md).

Web's **Overview** tracks these steps in a **Getting started** checklist.

## Add sandbox capacity

Sessions need somewhere to run:

- Choose the backend in **System** → **Manage sandbox configuration**, then [add a node](./nodes.md) from **Nodes**. The installer selects none.

Day-to-day operation, backups and upgrades are in [Operations](./operations.md).
