 * After Remove: the command that removes the node's service and files from its
 * host (deploy/node/node_install.py `uninstall_system`).
 * The installer first confirms with Core, at the node's own address, that the
 * node is removed, which holds from the removal on. The command uses sudo unless the shell is already root. A node enrolled with an earlier address may find it gone; then
 * `--force` skips only that confirmation. Nothing deletes sandboxes, volumes or
 * images. Like Add node's, the command downloads from the installation's public
 * URL, which the dialog reads (again, if it is not at hand): until it is read, if
 * the read fails (with Try again), or while other machines can't use it, the
 * dialog says so in place of the command. It never opens empty. With the
 * installation's `allow_insecure_origin` switch on, a non-loopback plain-HTTP
 * public URL is accepted, as it is for Add node.
